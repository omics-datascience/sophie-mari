# Tumor Drug Sensitivity Prediction Project

## Overview

This project replicates and extends the study presented in **"[Predicting Tumor Response to Drugs Based on Gene-Expression Biomarkers of Sensitivity Learned from Cancer Cell Lines](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07581-7)"**. The study aims to predict tumor response to drugs using gene-expression biomarkers learned from cancer cell lines, primarily by leveraging a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for prediction. This project allows users to predict drug sensitivity based on gene-expression data.
