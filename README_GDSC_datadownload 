          Welcome to the Wellcome Sanger Institute anonymous FTP site.
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Connecting to and downloading data from the FTP site
   ----------------------------------------------------

   Due to security concerns about the FTP protocol, all the major browser
   providers have dropped support for FTP (current browser versions of:
   Firefox; Chrome; Edge; and Safari).

   The biggest security risk is that FTP transfers data unencrypted, allowing
   attackers to steal, spoof and modify the data being transmitted.

   Thus we recommend three options to Users wishing to navigate and download data
   from our FTP site.

   - Use your web browser over https - https://ftp.sanger.ac.uk
   - Use the FileZilla Client - https://filezilla-project.org/
   - Use a Command line tool Linux, Mac and Windows all have these

   This ftp server can do dynamic compression and tar :
   
   Real Filename  'get' Filename      This server will 
   -------------  ------------------  -----------------------------------
   <filename>.Z   <filename>          Decompress file before transmitting
   <filename>     <filename>.Z        Compress or <filename> before
                                               transmitting
   <filename>     <filename>.tar      Tar <filename> before transmitting
   <filename>     <filename>.tar.Z    Tar and compress <filename> before
                                              transmitting

   Use .gz suffix instead of .Z to use gzip
   Use .tar.gz suffix to create gzip'd tar archives of whole dirs.

         All connections and transfers are logged.

  Recent changes as of 4th Feb 2014
  ---------------------------------
  We are currently restructuring and tidying the ftp filesystem and as 
  such the pub4, pub3 and pub2 folders will be removed and their contents
  either archived or relocated over the next few weeks. External urls 
  to these locations should still function as we are implementing 
  redirect rules in order to reduce disruption to ftp users. The 
  redirects currently in place are as follows:

  pub4/pathogens    -> /pub/project/pathogens
  pub/pathogens     -> /pub/project/pathogens
  pub4/cancerrxgene -> /pub/project/cancerrxgene
  pub4/opendoor     -> /pub/resources/opendoor
  pub4/theses       -> /pub/resources/theses
  pub4/repli-timing -> /pub/resources/data/repli-timing
  pub4/resources    -> /pub/resources
  pub4/humgen       -> /pub/project/humgen
  pub4/ibdgenetics  -> /pub/consortia/ibdgenetics
  pub3/sanhgmp      -> /pub/project/badger/sanhgmp
  pub2/wormbase     -> /pub/consortia/wormbase
